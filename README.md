## Building Web Applications

### For Context


This week, we will be grouped based on our Pod (POD A and POD B) to complete two different projects. They are:

1. Hotel Management System (HMS) --> (POD A)
2. Digital Health Management System (DHS) --> (POD B)

A project description, features to implement and approach to follow are in `POD_A.md` and `POD_B.md` file respectively at the root of this project.

At this point you are expect to checkout `POD_A.md` or `POD_B.md` file depending on your POD.

Happy Hacking ...

#How to work with git
1. Always pull project from the main branch into your local branch on your machine

2. **NEVER EVER EVER PUSH ANYTHING TO MAIN OR DEV-BRANCH BRANCHS!!!**

3. Always create new branch with names relivant to your task and push changes to the remote branch with the branch name same as your local branch

4. Make sure your code is functional before pushing and making pull request
